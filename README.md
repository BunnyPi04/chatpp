About Firefox Version
--------------
- **Chat++** was originally made for Chrome, and could run only on Chrome. However, after receiving many requests about the
Firefox version, I decided to port the extension to Firefox.<br>
It was a hard work! But fortunately, Firefox is currently supporting something called [WebExtensions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions),
which make life easier :D<br>
After long time waiting for the **Firefox WebExtensions** become more stable, as well as [a try on the old Firefox version](https://github.com/wataridori/chatpp/tree/firefox-old)
finally, the **Firefox Version** of Chat++ is out.
- According to the announcement in [Mozilla Developer Network page](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions) about the **WebExtensions**,
they are **currently in an experimental alpha state**, and Mozilla is **aiming for a first stable release in Firefox 48**.<br>
**WebExtensions** are now still working not well with version 46 and 47,
therefore, **Chat++ for Firefox** requires at least **version 48** to run. <br>
We'd suggest using [Firefox Nightly](https://nightly.mozilla.org/).<br>
See more about Firefox release schedule [here](https://wiki.mozilla.org/RapidRelease/Calendar).
- All the features in Chrome should work in Firefox as well, except for the syncing features. <br>
It means that your custom data will not be synced,
and if you use **Chat++ for Firefox** in two different computers, you must do config by your self.
- **Chat++ for Firefox** is still in **BETA**. Please notify me if you have any troubles.
- If you want a stable version, or do not want to use Firefox Nightly, just stick with [Chrome Version](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/chat%20%20-for-chatwork/amhfnpimdfcdcpnchjionbddjjbmofnl)
